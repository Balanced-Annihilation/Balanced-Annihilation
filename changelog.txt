9.46 -> 10.24
24/02/2019

Balance change summary:  9.46 - 10.24  (22/09/2016 - 24/02/2019)

General
 • Costs rounded (deviation: 0 - 1.5%)
 • Global weapon/explosion area-of-effect 'edgeeffectiveness' buff of 0.15 (as a correction for collision volume been made smaller around 2012-2013)
 • Death/selfd unit explosion damages have changed, due to graphical effect size being linked to its damages. (mostly for non significant units)
 • When reclaiming a feature, the income that it generates consists of two parts: a fixed part that is the minimal speed, and an additional part, proportional to the build power.
The minimal reclaim speed when reclaiming features has been lowered from 60/s to 12.5/s. The additional speed that each point of build power provides has been increased by an 11.25x factor (0.02 => 0.225). This results in reclaimers under 225 bp being slower, and those over 225 bp being faster than what they were in 9.46
 • Some (mostly) useless order/state buttons removed like t1 mex on/off, antinuke firestate, various buildings with repeat/stop/wait without function

Behavior
 • Cheap "Nanoframe shielding" countermeasure: a nanoframe (unfinished unit) will only get hit when its build over 5%
 • Flamethrower weapons dont spray as wide as before (looks better)
 • EMP units (bladewing/emp-spider/stiletto/dragonfly) wont target non-emapable or underwater units
 • Some missile speeds adjusted to start slightly slower and accelerate a bit faster

Movement
 • Continuous aiming. Units aim before weapons have loaded. Starts when enemy at weapon range +10% (no +10% for llt's and popups)
 • Reverse move ability for: (with limited speed) corban,armmanni,armmart,armart,corwolv,cortrem
 • Omnidirectional 'raw' unit pathing, instead of limited to just 8 directions
 • Unit movement stats adjusted: maxspeed/acceleration/brakerate/turnrate to cope with new engine behavior. (no more constant wiggling that slowed down units and thus never reaching maxspeed)
 • Vehicles/hovers: reduced max speed after engine change (avg -11%) and standardized accelrate/brakerate according to maxspeed and turnrate
 • Kbots: +15% brakerate/accel/turnrate
 • All: movement: turninplace = true, anglelimit = 90
 • Improved Air Units maneuverability and lowered turnradius (allowing close move commands)
 • Transports load/drop behavior changed due to its code being stripped from the engine side
 • Hovercraft can now be transported

Commanders
 • Buildrange +30%
 • Comblast lethal range to other coms reduced 20%
 • Torso turnspeed +33%, dgun reloadspeed -10%
 • Underwater walk speed decreases to 66% of it's value at depth > 47
 • Underwater laser dps increased to 150 (default) and 75 (subs)
 • Decoy commanders: cost -8%, buildoptions: Radar, LLT and AA, lasers/buildpower from commander

 • Tremor: metal cost -10%, accuracy +15%
 • Pelican: damages +15%, health +15%, turretspeed +33%
 • EMP spider: auto heals +15 hp per second (ba9.37 had 30 before it was removed)
 • Banisher: missile blows up in the air after it is out of fuel
 • Sniper: weapon hit explosion has a distinct red color tint

T3
 • Vanguard: damage +15%
 • Marauder: damage +10%, health +5%
 • Shiva: sightdistance +74%
 • KrogStomp reintroduced vs scouts/pws/aks
 • Underwater gantries: removed Lun/Sokolov (heavy hovercraft)

Air
 • T1 Airlabs: cost -5% (m and e equally)
 • T1 Aircons: buildpower +10%, energy cost -10%, buildtime -10%
 • Sea aircons: buildpower +10%, cost decreased (ARM: m:273->150, e:25677->7800, CORE: m:271-140, e:25650->8200)
 • Fighters: wont slow down and stick behind their targets, this resulted in clumps of fighters killing each other by their missile AoE and death explosions
 • Fighters: range +22% (due to slower missile speed and missile turnrate)
 • Fighters: explode with less damage (half damage, 2/3 AoE)
 • Thunder: health +7%, speed +4%
 • Hurricane/Phoenix: between before and after the nerf of BA v7.92 (decreased buildtime and reduced energy cost)
 • Liche: maxspeed -5% maxSpeed, energy cost +5%, buildTime +2.5%, damage to commander 3350 -> 3150
 • Cutlass: health -20%, damages -15%
 • T2 air transports: loads up to four 2x2 footprint or less units, or one 3x3 unit. Unloads all units at once.

AA
 • Added "Set Priority" command order menu toggle (Fighters/Bombers/No priority)
 • Packo/Sam: single missile per shot instead of duos (same dps)
 • Chainsaw/Eradicator: energy cost -16%, airlos 1000 -> 1060, range 1050 -> 1125, missile starts faster
 • Archangel: missile damages +33%
 • Manticore: flak reload time -18%

Buildings

 • Viper: missile explodes at ~maxrange, preventing ridiculous overshooting (missile speed -14%)
 • Nano: self-d does more damage than basically non-existent

Long range plasma
 • Plasma shields: 50% weaker to non LRPC shots, range +10%, cost -20%
 • Vulcan/Buzzsaw: cost +40%
 • Bertha/Intimidator: Area of Effect +15%


Sea redesign

9. 46 sea pros and cons:
 • + Micromanagement orientated / limited in numbers due to overall higher metal costs
 • + High early game stakes
 • + Many theoretical possibilities (amphibs, hovercrafts, seaplanes, ships, submarines)
 • - Not much substance beside the very first 5-8 minutes
 • - Repetitive gameplay, mostly relying on 2 units (destroyers and scouts)
 • - Lack of interactions with land due to uneffective/high costs on the alternative units (amphibs, hovers, seaplanes)
 • - Combomb occluding many of the possibilities because of its strong place in sea gameplay (early combomb versus destroyers + reclaim)

What has been attempted with BA 10:
 • Keep the prices high enough that sea cannot truely be "spammed", and insist micro and unit combinations
 • Increase the number of possibilities following a sea start
 • Improve the dynamic of the game / ensure it's possible to tech/switch strategies without any downtime
 • Give more space to non-destroyers / specialize unittypes / add more situations that don't require destroyers
 • Add more possibilities of land/sea interactions 
 • Lower commander Max Speed underwater, thus making underwater combomb be more of a casual/opportunistic strategy

Core changes:
 • Transport ship load/unload underwater was disabled
 • Hovercraft transportation was enabled
 • Overall lower costs, lower Build Times, lower Build Speeds, lighter ships
 • Reworked movement type: Turninplace with 90 anglelimit, accel and brake rates based on turnrate
 • More durable wrecks (+100% Health)
 • Distinction between depthcharges (underwater only) and torpedoes (underwater and surface)
 • 2 completely new units:
	- Nano platform: similar to nano turret, on a floating platform
	- Plasma ships: All purpose, surface only, plasma cannon ship
 • Reintroduced T2 torpedo launchers, with increased firepower and costs
 • 4 completely reviewed units:
	- T1 Geos: can be built underwater (mostly when using map_waterlevel)
	- T1 Offshore mexes, in place of underwater mexes: replicate an expansion / mex raiding phase similar to land
	- Lun: 1150m/33000e, 4750hp, UW capable cannon, 370 aoe Damages per 1. 8s
	- Sokolov: 950m/12000e, 3800hp, Surface only Heavy beam laser, 2150 Damages over 1s per 9s
 • One deleted unit:
	- T1 Sonar station with sonar added to T1 Floating radar tower, scouts, torpedo launchers and amphibious tanks
 • Reviewed Amphibious complex build menus / removed submarines from it
 • Reviewed Seaplane platform as a proper T1. 5 lab / adjusted costs aswell as the constructor's costs and menu

	- Corvette: raider, fast, high dps/cost, low armor
	- Patrol Boats: Support role (not a scout), anti-air, vision, sonar, light laser
	- Plasma Frigates: All purpose, raider and skirmisher, good dps, relatively fast, medium armor

	- Carriers: Economic support (energy production 250 -> 300), air repairs, antinuke, radar
	- Battleships: Skirmisher role, high aoe Damages, heavy armor, fast, poor manoeuvrability
	- Missile ship: Artillery role, cluster missiles, high aoe Damages, low armor/manoeuvrability, slow, radar, light antiair

 Movement: 
 • Uses Raw move to avoid needless turns in water
 • Ships can now turn-in-place (as it did back in 2012). This allows better control on boats by being able to anticipate if the unit will slow down for the turn or keep its max speed.
 • Globally, maxspeeds, accelerations, brakesrates and turnrates have been decreased for a smoother handling and better feeling of inertia. In terms of balance, this also results in ships being globally weaker to non instantaneous (non beamlasers) weapons (including each other as most ships use plasmas).

Other:

Battle/Autohost will handle all battlestates messages (warnings, errors, pauses, lags, afk, resigns...) and all autohosts messages (votes, rings...)
"!xxx" commands are hidden from players and only the feedbacks will be seen in the battle/autohost console.
Autohosts feedbacks on invalid commands or rings are hidden from players unless your name is mentionned by the host or you are the one who attempted the command.
Autohosts vote feedbacks only include: who started the vote, whose votes are missing, and vote results.

 Make sure you put the game on: Game continues if commander dies.
 Then pick one of the mod options:

 •  Kill Everything: Just disables all of the gadgets and lets normal Spring rules apply.

 •  Commander: Team based com ends, if an allyteam has its last com destroyed the whole
	  team is eliminated, as long as one player in the team has a com left the whole team
    remains in play. 

 •  Commander Control: In addition to the above a player without a com is unable to give
 	  orders to his units, all he can do is share them to an ally (sharing to enemies and
	  selfD are disabled). An ally can take his units by using the ".luarules take" command.
	  It was unfortunately not possible to merge this into the regular .take.
