    "outpost.dds ".."Outposts can speed up any construction, but they're less cost effective for that than FARKs (built by the outpost) and they spend energy continuously.",
	"armtech.dds ".."To tech up, build a Tech Center, then upgrade it progressively until Tech Tier4. This unlocks high-tier upgrades in factories and outposts as well.",
	"armtech.dds ".."When under attack, Tech Centers can become 70% more resistant if disabled (ON/OFF button or Ctrl+X shortcut)",
	"corgat.dds ".."Gatlings and Flashes are terrific anti-kbot vehicles, very EMP-resistant and moderately effective against lighter gunships. When facing tanks or combos of plasma and missile kbots, don't expect them to last long.",
