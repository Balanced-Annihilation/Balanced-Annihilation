 Make sure you put the game on: Game continues if commander dies.
 Then pick one of the mod options:

 -  Kill Everything: Just disables all of the gadgets and lets normal Spring rules apply.

 -  Commander: Team based com ends, if an allyteam has its last com destroyed the whole
	  team is eliminated, as long as one player in the team has a com left the whole team
    remains in play. 

 -  Commander Control: In addition to the above a player without a com is unable to give
 	  orders to his units, all he can do is share them to an ally (sharing to enemies and
	  self-d are disabled). An ally can take his units by using the ".luarules take" command.
	  It was unfortunately not possible to merge this into the regular .take.
