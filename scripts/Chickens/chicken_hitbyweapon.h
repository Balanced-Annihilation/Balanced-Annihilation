//Needs defines before usage:
//UNITSIZE 1-20, small for small units, large for large units, 
//MAXTILT ~100, how much unit should move
//BASEPIECE piecename, 
//HITSPEED <55>, for small units, <15> for large units


// angle[x|z] is always [-500;500], damage is multiplied by 100
// thus if our maxtilt is 100/100, then we get 500, which is about 2.7 degrees of max tilt, which should also kind of scale with unitsize, e.g. smaller units should tilt more, while larger less
// 

// hitspeed should be a part of unitsize, to simplify scaling
